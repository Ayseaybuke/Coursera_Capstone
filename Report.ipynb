    "For this report I used a few different maps that could help students to decide the best neighborhood to move in Toronto based on it's income, population and restaurants in the neighborhood. In order to do that I've used the 2016 Census information combined with choropleth maps to display the wealthier/cheaper and populated or not neighborhoods and Foursquare data to display the current restaurants in each region.\n",
